##Overview
This was is simple hangman game written in javascript. But by no means is the game simple. I made this game as difficult as possible. 1,291 of the hardest words in the English dictionary are in this game. I compiled a list combining difficult words from International Spelling Bees, [GRE Vocabulary Study Guides](https://www.kaptest.com/study/gre/top-52-gre-vocabulary-words/GRE) , and [Dr. Robert Heckendorn's List of Hard to Spell Words](http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/misspell.html). I chose a theme that correlated in the design of this game: [The Saw Movie Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_(franchise)).
